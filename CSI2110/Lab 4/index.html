<h2>Binary Tree Traversal and Euler Tours</h2> 
<p>
Study the binary tree implementation of Goodrich et al. The approach
consists of an ADT binary tree (BinaryTree.java) extending the ADT
tree (Tree.java) which is implemented with a linked list
(LinkedBinaryTree.java). These classes are all part of the
net.datastructures package which is contained (as far as required) in
the zip archive for this lab.
</p>

<p>
Run the code provided in the skeleton class Lab4. It will build a
small binary tree and print the nodes onto the console. Draw this
binary tree on a piece of paper.
</p>

<p> Write down the notes which would be visited by the pre-order,
in-order and post-order traversal algorithms. Determine the height of
the tree.
</p>

<p>
Study the code in the skeleton Lab4.java. You have to implement the
missing section such that Lab4.java prints the nodes visited by the
pre-order, in-order and post-order traversals. Additionally, you need
to print the height of the tree. You will have to extend the EulerTour
class from the net.datastructure package to achieve these outputs.
