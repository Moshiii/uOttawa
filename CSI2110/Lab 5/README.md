- Download the following file

         lab5.zip


- Study the Heap implementation of the Priority Queue ADT present in `HeapPriorityQueue.java`
study specifically insert and removeMin methods in that class.

- Implement a test class that uses a Priority Queue to return the kth smallest element in a list.
Assume the first argument is the value of k, and the list after are the elements list.
Assume the key and the element are the same at each node.

- Compile and run your code with different arguments
Assuming the test class name is PQTest and we are looking for the fifth smallest element in the set {2,10,7,13,4,18,11,16,3}. we use:

` java PQTest 5 2 10 7 13 4 18 11 16 3`

`The 5th smallest element is 10`
