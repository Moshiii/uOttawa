<h1>Lab 9</h1>
</p>

<h2>Adjacency List Implementation of a Graph and DFS </h2>
<p>
Download the archive <tt>Lab9.zip</tt> and extract the
<tt>SimpleGraph</tt> application. The application reads an edge-list
from a file and constructs a Graph. The Graph is stored as
<tt>AdjacencyListGraph</tt>. The application simple prints all the
vertices followed by all the edges. The archives also contain two
graph files which you can use as input for the application:
  <ul>
    <li><tt>graph.txt</tt></li>
    <li><tt>graph2.txt</tt></li>
  </ul>
</p>


<h2>New Graph</h2>
<p>
Define a new graph in a textfile and print it with the application.
</p>


<h2>Study the Goodrich et al. Implementation</h2>
<p>
Study the <tt>AdjacencyListGraph</tt> implementation of the
<tt>Graph</tt> ADT by Goodrich et al. Keep in mind the structure
discussed in class. Notice that the adjacency lists are implemented in
the inner class <tt>MyVertex</tt> and the references from the edges in
the inner class <tt>MyEdge</tt>. The <tt>Graph</tt> ADT does not
define any traversal method. The traversal of graphs is implemented
with a separate class <tt>DFS</tt>. These classes are all part of the
net.datastructures package which is contained (as far as required) in
the zip archive for this lab.
</p>


<h2>Printing with Generic DFS</h2>
<p>
The program <tt>SimpleGraph</tt> has a routine <tt>void printDFS(
String vert )</tt> which currently does nothing. Please implement this
routine by sub-classing <tt>DFS</tt>. An anonymous inner class would
be appropriate. The routine should print the vertices as they are
visited by the traversal: once when they are first visited and a
second time when a vertex is finished.
