<h2>Hashing Functions</h2>
<p>
In this laboratory, you will be able to explore the distribution of
hashed keys in a hash table. The class <tt>HashFunctionAnalysis</tt>
creates a hash table of a specified size and it counts how many keys
will hash to each index for a specific data-set. The behaviour of the
hash function can be analyzed by printing a histogram of the
distrubtion of the hashed keys in the table. The keys in this example
are strings and hash functions can be tested on any text stored as a
textfile.
</p>

<p>
Study and run the code in the <tt>TestHashFunc.java</tt>. You will
have to provide the filename of a textfile at the command prompt. The
implemented hash function is very simple: It takes the first 8 bytes of
the ASCII code of each word as the key and truncates it from the left
after ceil(log(N)) bits. It interpretes these bits than as the integer
index for the hash table. If you test the code with "alphabet.txt"
with a hash table size of 256, you can notice that each key maps to
a different index.
</p>
 
<p>
<em> Please implement a better hashing function. </em> 
</p>

<p>
Notice how the abstract class <tt>HashFunctionAnalysis</tt> needs to
be extended defining the abstract method <tt>int hashFunction( String
word )</tt>. Notice also that defining <tt>TestHashFunc.DEBUG</tt>
as <tt>true</tt> or <tt>false</tt> will create more or less verbose
output, respectively.
