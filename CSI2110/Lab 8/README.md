#Lab 8
###Heap Sort, Merge Sort and Quick Sort

Download the archive Lab8.zip and extract the `TrySorts` applet. The applet makes use of the following sorting implementations

- BubbleSort.java
- HeapSortInPlace.java
- QuickSortInPlace.java


Use the applet with various setting and observe the behavior. Note, you can have a look at the array before and after sorting for array sizes under 100 elements. The `New Elements` button will generate a new array to be sorted.

####In-Place Quick Sort

The quick-sort implementation is not randomized. Randomize the pivot selection and observe any change in running time.

####Merge Sort

Replace the `BubbleSort` implementation with `MergeSort` and compare the sorting algorithm with `Quick Sort` and `Heap Sort`.
